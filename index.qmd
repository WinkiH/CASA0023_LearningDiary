# About me

## Who?

Hello! This is Winki currently doing MSc Urban Spatial Science at CASA UCL. This is my fourth year spending in the UK but the first year in London! I am from Hong Kong, please do give me a shout if you are going to visit Hong Kong in the future and I'll be your tour guide :).

[![This is me spending time in Iceland during the field trip back in my bachelor degree :). Behind me is Jökulsárlón-Glacier lagoon with numerous floating icebergs that detached from various glacier outlets around the lagoon.](images/iceland.png)](pics-of-me)

Before I came to CASA as a Data Scientist (self-proclaimed), I am a physical geographer who is always amazed by the physical landscape. I love travelling around the world and exploring the nature :). The most impressive trip is the field trip to Iceland (pics above), it was the first time for me to walk over glaciers and fool around glacial features e.g., walk and climb over moraines, visiting gigantic glacial erosion features. Spending three days for collecting field samples was kind of interesting yet tired not gonna lie (haha I enjoyed it tho). I don't really have a strong background in computer programming, I usually use ArcGIS and R during my bachelor for analysing changes in physical landscapes e.g., factors for driving glacial retreats/ ice berg carving in the Antarctica/ projecting surface temperatures in Brazil under different RCPs scenarios (1.26 - 5.85). I am particularly interested in looking at climate, hazards, risks, and resilience in different countries especially sea-level changes in low-lying atolls/ island countries e.g., Tuvalu, Kiribati.

In CASA, all the computer programming skills are challenging yet interesting to me. I have never thought of I can create some cool maps using Python or demonstrating a more advanced spatial analysis in R like the ones that we've tried in CASA0005. CASA0023 is more like an extension from CASA0005 which I found it quite useful, we don't only stick to QGIS, R, but also using Google Earth Engine as an alternative for remote sensing. Focusing more on theory parts in this course also allows me to understand how remote sensing actually works while deploying data. I am particularly interested in getting in touch with Google Earth Engine which I have never tried before, hope it works well! I really enjoyed my time at CASA, and I find the skills are really transferable to my career development (although I still messed with github at certain times...). Yeah! Hope this tiny little self-intro makes things clear about me :)

## What? Fun facts about me

-   I love scrolling through Google Map/ Google Earth/ Tube Map (This gives me some travelling vibe!)

-   I am so into sea-level change that I can spend an hour or more to explain the theories behind.

-   I like sun bathing and getting tanned, in other words, I dislike winter.

-   I prefer taking buses rather than tube (except DLR) as I could see the view outside

-   I am more comfortable with R than Python...

-   I love doing road trip but I don't have a driving license.
