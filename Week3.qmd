# Corrections and enhancement

## Key terms summary

Remote sensing often requires corrections or sometimes requires enhancement to overcome the flaws of the original image introduced by sensor itself (e.g., angle of viewing)/ landscape (e.g., hilly surface)/ atmosphere (e.g., atmospheric scattering of radiation) etc.

1.  **Geometric corrections** for image distortions introduced by physical factors e.g., sensor/ landscape itself

-   Ground Control Points (GCPs) from local map or handheld devices needed to match the known points (of the image) to a location-referenced dataset.

-   Geometric transformation algorithms to obtain RMSE (root-mean-squared-error), the lower the better \~0.5.

-   More GCPs are required in order to lower the RMSE.

-   Resample the raster layer.

2.  **Atmospheric corrections** for image distortions introduced by atmosphere e.g., atmospheric scattering and topographic attenuation

-   Necessary for measuring biophysical parameters e.g., NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index).

-   Relative VS Absolute.

-   Relative: the use of Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) or Pseudo-invariant Features (PIFs) to normalise relative to different bands within an image OR relative to different dates.

-   Absolute: requires empirical data e.g., atmospheric model and local atmospheric visibility to scale up surface reflectance.

3.  **Orthorectification** correction for image distortions introduced by the view angle of the sensor â€¢ Requires geometry and DEMs (elevation model).

-   Consider the effect of solar azimuth and solar zenith.

-   Solar azimuth:

-   Solar zenith:

4.  **Radiometric Calibration** for transforming image brightness from Digital Number (DN) to spectral radiance

-   Sensors only able to capture image brightness and stored as DN.

-   Calibrated in a lab before launching the sensor.
